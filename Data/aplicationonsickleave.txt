Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, I have been advised to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work once I return. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
